# Data Cleaning in SQL
This is a documented personal project on Data cleaning with SQL and all the process are explained therein.


## Introduction
Data cleaning is a crucial process in any data analytics project, as it ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate, complete, and consistent. SQL is a powerful query language for managing and manipulating relational databases. The project will involve identifying and addressing errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the dataset, as well as optimizing the data structure for improved analysis. By the end of this project, I aim to have a clean and reliable dataset ready for further analysis and insights.

In this project, I used the Microsoft SQL Server in cleaning the dataset.

### Data Sourcing
The dataset that I used in this project is open-source data without any PII (Personally Identifiable Information) that I acquired from Kaggle. The dataset includes information of real estate data from the hot Nashville housing market.
There are more than 56600 rows on this dataset and 30 columns that are titled: Unnamed, Parcel ID, Land Use, Property Address, Suite/ Condo #, Property City, Sale Date, Sale Price, Legal Reference, Sold As Vacant, Multiple Parcels Involved in Sale, Owner Name, Address, City, State, Acreage, Tax District, Neighborhood, Image, Land Value, Building Value, Total Value, Finished Area, Foundation Type, Year Built, Exterior Wall, Grade, Bedrooms, Full Bath, Half Bath. This dataset has a lot of inconsistencies which makes this dataset perfect to practice data cleaning.

## Objective of the project

1. Standardize Sales Date column format
2. Populate Null Property Address data
3. Populate Null Property City data
4. Change abbreviations and correct misspellings in Column Land Use
5. Remove Duplicates
6. Delete Unused Columns

## Skills / Concepts Demonstrated

The following skills were demonstrated in this data cleaning project using SQL:
1. SQL database: The project requires knowledge and expertise in SQL for managing and manipulating relational databases
2. Data wrangling: Data cleaning requires the ability to identify and address errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data.
3. Data analysis: The project requires knowledge of data analysis techniques to identify patterns, trends, and insights in the data.
4. Data optimization: The project requires the ability to optimize the data structure for improved analysis and insights.
5. Problem-solving: Data cleaning projects require problem-solving skills to identify and address issues in the data.
6. Attention to detail: Data cleaning requires a keen eye for detail to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
7. Communication: The project requires effective communication skills to present findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
