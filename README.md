# Data Cleaning in SQL
This is a documented personal project on Data cleaning with SQL and all the process are explained therein.


## Introduction
Data cleaning is a crucial process in any data analytics project, as it ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate, complete, and consistent. SQL is a powerful programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases. The project will involve identifying and addressing errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data, as well as optimizing the data structure for improved analysis. By the end of this project, I aim to have a clean and reliable dataset ready for further analysis and insights.

In this project, I used the Microsoft SQL server in cleaning the dataset.
